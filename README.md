Records of the Code Wars

## What is this?
Since Code Wars uses Chai and Mocha, I might as well try out their tests so that I gain further experience.

## Instructions

### Installation
`npm install`

### Run Tests
`npm run test ./**/*`

### Run Tests (Typescript only)
`npm run test ./ts/**/*.test.ts`
